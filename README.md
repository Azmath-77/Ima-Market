##  CAPSTONE PROJECT


##  🚀Problem Statement
To harness India's IT talent for national projects, we propose two
interconnected platforms: the National Importance Project Portal, which lists crucial
projects with details for both financial and technical contributions, and the Skill-Based
Volunteer Network, which matches IT professionals with these projects based on their 
skills and interests. The portal will facilitate project tracking, collaboration, and feedback,
while the network will enable resource sharing, training, and recognition for volunteers.
These platforms aim to provide rapid support for projects like the Ima Market recovery in
Manipur, leveraging IT skills to address national challenges efficiently.


## Solution
We propose two interconnected platforms to harness India’s IT talent for national projects: the National Importance Project Portal and an E-commerce Website. The portal will act as a centralized hub, listing critical projects with detailed information on financial and technical contributions, while facilitating project tracking, collaboration, and feedback. The e-commerce website will support these initiatives by providing a marketplace for products and services related to the projects, enabling resource sharing and engagement from the community. Together, these platforms aim to address national challenges efficiently, with an initial focus on projects like the Ima Market recovery in Manipur, leveraging IT skills and resources for impactful solutions.
