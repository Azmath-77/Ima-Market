#####  üöÄCAPSTONE PROJECT


##  Problem Statement
To harness India's IT talent for national projects, we propose two
interconnected platforms: the National Importance Project Portal, which lists crucial
projects with details for both financial and technical contributions, and the Skill-Based
Volunteer Network, which matches IT professionals with these projects based on their 
skills and interests. The portal will facilitate project tracking, collaboration, and feedback,
while the network will enable resource sharing, training, and recognition for volunteers.
These platforms aim to provide rapid support for projects like the Ima Market recovery in
Manipur, leveraging IT skills to address national challenges¬†efficiently.
